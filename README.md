SVM stands for Support Vector Machine, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. This code is designed to distinguish between muffins and cupcakes. It takes various material data inputs related to muffins and cupcakes, learns to differentiate between them, and displays charts. When you input any combination, it tells you which category it belongs to.
